Explainable Adaptive Learning Research Prototype with Pedagogical Decision Engine
# Explainable Adaptive Learning System (EALS)

## Overview
This project implements a research prototype of an Explainable Adaptive Learning Decision Engine that models learner cognitive states, performs adaptive instructional interventions, and generates interpretable pedagogical explanations.

## Research Motivation
Existing adaptive learning systems modify instruction but do not explain the reasoning behind decisions. This system introduces structured pedagogical decision explainability.

## System Architecture
Learner Data → Cognitive State Estimation → Adaptive Decision → Pedagogical Explanation → Learning Outcome Simulation

## Features
- Synthetic learner simulation
- Cognitive state modeling
- Adaptive instructional decision engine
- Structured pedagogical explanation generator
- Learning progression simulation
- Experimental research environment

## Research Purpose
- Explainable AI in Education
- Adaptive Learning Transparency
- Educational Decision Interpretability
- Patent-oriented system design

## Technology
Python, Streamlit, Simulation-based evaluation

## Status
Research prototype – experimental validation stage.

## Author
Research and development for explainable adaptive educational systems.
